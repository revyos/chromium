chromium (132.0.6834.110-1) unstable; urgency=high

  We are planning to remove the chromium-shell package due to lack of
  use and build issues, unless we hear from people who are actively using
  it for things that can't be done with other packages. If you are actively
  using this package (as opposed to the package being installed
  automatically due to some dependency), please let me know. Email
  <dilinger@debian.org>, and tell me your use case, and why the chromium
  and chromium-driver packages won't work for you.

  If I don't hear of any interest in keeping chromium-shell around, then
  we are planning to mark it as deprecated and remove it around
  chromium 137 or so.
